# why have I started to learn to code?

## That's not the question, if not, why have I started so late?
### Let's start at the very beginning.

I have never liked to use the story of my life to give sympathy or pity, and this is not going to be an exception, I have always achieved what I earned for my great work attitude, humility and dedication.

That said, I will put in context why I have always dreamed of being a programmer, and until now, I have not realized how wrong I have been for so long.

I grew up in Benidorm, in a family of a divorced mother with few resources, at the age of 14, I had had to choose what I have to study, I always knew it, I wanted to work with computers that at that time it fascinated me. Although I only had access to one of a friend and another in the library when it was available (which it was never).

But that was impossible because the family economy could not support studies in a large city (Valencia), which was where computing engineering was only taught at that time.

So I had to choose something else that was close and allowed me to work in the afternoons to help the family economy, I studied cook.

Comparing studies and work I finished my studies at age 18 (I was the second of my promotion) and started working as a cook in a large hotel in Benidorm, with the first payroll I had, I bought a computer in instalments (a Pentium III).

On that computer, without even Internet access, I learned typing and using Windows 98, some MS-DOS and some command line. I bought the only book I found to learn to program C, but it was in English (my English was practically null), and the concepts, were very complex (I was not very friendly for newbies) so I put my dream back in a nook in my brain.

Since then,  I have worked and struggled to help my mother and my family in general to prosper and that my daughter can study anything she wants in their future.

And here am I, 37 years old and has helped many people to achieve their dreams and I haven't fought for mine.
