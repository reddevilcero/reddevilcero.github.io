I want to share some thoughts about the book I have read recently [Mind for numbers](https://www.google.com/search?q=ISBN+039916524X) and its [Coursera Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn), and helpful tips for learning code or anything you want. 

 <h4 align="center" style="font-style:italic">First of all, this post is a quick look at complex matters and concepts.</h4>


<h2 align="center" style="font-weight:bold">Tip</h2>

Pre-read any lecture or article (1 to 2 minutes) looking for headings, questions, or before you read it more in deep will help you to create a structure than you later will be filled with the contents. 

<h2 align="center" style="font-weight:bold">Introduction to the Focused and Diffuse Modes</h2>

Let me make an analogy between the brain and a computer running an Internet browser. 
So the Focused mode is the web browser history of your brain, if you make the right query, it will return a bunch of links to websites of "how-to"…. Whenever you already know those websites. 
The diffuse mode instead is more like surfing the Web fast clicking links and banners to other websites and stay enough time to click and move to another…..maybe your brain already has visited the site with that magical answer…. But still isn't the first result when you do your search in the history.

<h2 align="center" style="font-weight:bold">Einstellung effect</h2>

The Einstellung effect is the negative effect of previous experience when solving new problems.
Keeping with the analogy when you search the first's results are always the ones you already know and are confident at, not the bests you maybe know, but you always use the first's results from your history. The first approach to new problems can be misleading due to this effect. You have to get rid of old ideas when you learn new ones. 

<h2 align="center" style="font-weight:bold" >Be creative</h2>

The diffuse mode is the innovative mode of your brain, the one who create/invent new neural structures that later your focused mode can follow to repeat or recreated those thoughts but not to create them.
For that reason, when more you think about being creative, the fewer originals your ideas will be as you are trying to follow patterns you already know and not create them.
Alternate between both modes is vital to your learning, one without the other is useless.

<h2 align="center" style="font-weight:bold">More about Diffuse and Focus Mode</h2>

To have new ideas and resolve problems is crucial not only concentrate at the beginning, if not as well leave to have attention to what we are learning. I know it is strange and could sound not appropriate, but you will understand when to do it and why it is essential.

For the most, the change between diffuse mode and focus mode occurs naturally, when getting distracted and leaves past a small-time.
Walk, going to the gym o any activity that liberates the conscient brain part. This can take even hours(_if don't use specific tips_) o what I like to call BDW, Bed, Drive, Walk (_this differs for each person_) but basically any relaxing activity than help you start your autonomous mode(_more about this soon_).

Maybe after that relaxing session, you may see how quick and easy the solution appears, of course, not without a previous work in focus mode.
That "EUREKA" moment is one of the small pleasures of life(_at least for me_).

But don't expect that walking, going to the gym, or sleeping to teach you something. It is the alternation between both modes that will finally give you the expected result.

To maximize your learning, do small study sessions instead of long and tedious ones, even when you are resting o doing other things your diffuse mode is still working in what you were concentrating/studying. Don't worry if you think you are never in that mode. Everyone does; It is the default mode of the brain.

Making a simile between study and the gym, lifting weight all day is not going to help you to grow your muscles, as those muscles need time and rest between sessions to develop bigger and stronger in a long way. The persistence in time is the key to everything!

## General triggers of the diffuse mode:

* Go to the gym.
* Play football, basket or any similar sport.
* Run, walk, swim.
* Dance.
* Go by car or public transport (_driving or as a passenger_).
* Draw or paint.
* Have a shower or bath.
* Listen to music, especially instrumental
* Play songs that you know well.
* Meditate or pray.
* Sleep (the diffuse mode definitive!)

### Other general triggers of the diffuse mode to use with caution or as a reward(max 10 min). Because it can take you to a new focus mode.

* Play videogames.
* Surf the web.
* Talk/messaging friends.
* Read a book.
* Watch Tv.
* Help others in a simple problem (_in my case help my daughter with homework.. the easy ones Jajaja_).

<h2 align="center" style="font-weight:bold">Tip</h2>

Do not compare yourself with others; take the time that you need to understand the new concepts. If you want to put yourself at the same level of others, you won't dedicate enough time to dominate the matter, and you will finish even more lagging, or simply you will finish leaving because of your frustration and the feeling that you are not good at this.
